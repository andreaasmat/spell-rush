# Spell Rush

A spelling and grammar game inspired by Duolingo — demo build.

**[Play it here](https://andreaasmat.github.io/spell-rush/)**

## How It Works

- Steer a car down a road and choose between two word spellings
- Pick the correctly spelled word to score points — hit the wrong one and you crash
- 10 words per round, scored on accuracy and speed
- Results show your score breakdown, mistakes to learn from, and your Duo Peers ranking

## Features

- **Duo Peers** — See how you rank against a weekly group of 30 peers
- **Mistake Review** — Every wrong answer is shown with the correct spelling so you learn as you play
- **Score Breakdown** — Base score (correct words x 200) + time bonus for finishing fast

## Built With

HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no dependencies. Runs entirely in the browser.
